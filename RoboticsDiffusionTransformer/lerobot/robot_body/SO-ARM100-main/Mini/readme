This is an experiment in printing the entire SO-Arm as a single piece that can then articulate once the supports are removed.
The clearances are only 0.2mm between all parts which has proven to be ok in test pieces, but I find hard to believe will work on the whole thing.
I shall know by tomorrow morning whether it will move after printing on a Bambu A1, with a 0.4mm brass nozzle, 0.2mm layer thickness with supports above 30degrees in light green PLA+.
Yes, the colour of PLA effects the end result. Probably due to subtle chemical differences in the dyes but I've no clear hard evidence or research to support this guess.
I'd welcome any feedback on different machines and settings and whether the finished print can be made to move freely with the present clearance between parts.
